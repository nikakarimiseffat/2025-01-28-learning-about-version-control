Learning about Version Control

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What I like most about version control:
- Version control makes collaboration so much easier by keeping track of changes and allowing multiple contributors to work on the same project without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.

What I find most challenging about version control:
- When I run `git log --oneline --graph --all` I have no idea how to read it or how to envision the 'graph' so it makes it challenging to envision the structure of my repository.
